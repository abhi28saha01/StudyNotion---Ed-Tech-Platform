**Project Description**

StudyNotion is a fully functional **Ed-Tech platform** that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERNstack, which includes ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and ExpressJS.
<br><br>
<b>StudyNotion aims to provide:</b>
<ul>
  <li>A seamless and interactive learning experience for students, makingeducation more accessible and engaging</li>
  <li>A platform for instructors to showcase their expertise and connect withlearners across the globe.</li>
  <li>The platform includes role-based actions tailored for specific roles, such as <b>teachers</b> and <b>students</b>. Teachers have permissions to create, update, and delete courses, while students are restricted to consuming content without modification privileges.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<i>In the following sections, we will cover the technical details of the platform,including:</i>
<ol>
  <li><b>System architecture : </b>The StudyNotion ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back-end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front-end serving as the client and the back-end and database serving as the server.
</li>
  <li><b>Front-End : </b>To build the front end, I use frameworks and libraries such as ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I also use CSS and
Tailwind, which are styling frameworks that help make the user interface look good and responsive. Additionally, I use some npm packages to add extra functionality to the front end. To manage the state of the application, I use Redux, which is a popular state management library for React. Finally, I use a development environment called VSCode, which is a popular code editor, to develop the front end.</li>
  <li><b>Back-End : </b>StudyNotion uses a monolithic architecture, with the backend built using Node.js and Express.js, and MongoDB as the primary database. Monolithic architecture refers to a design approach where all the modules of the application are combined into a single large program, with a single codebase, to enable better control, security, and performance.Overall, the back-end of StudyNotion is designed to provide a robust and scalable solution for an ed-tech platform, with a focus on security, reliability, and ease of use.</li>
  <li><b>API Design : </b>The StudyNotion platform's API is designed following the REST architectural style. The API is implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It uses JSON for data
exchange and follows standard HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</li>
  <li><b>Database : </b>The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing course content such as videos, images, and PDFs. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.</li>
